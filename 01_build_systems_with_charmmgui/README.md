# Instructions to setup Folate-NADPH complex in aqueous and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme environments for CHARMM and AMBER
### A detailed video tutorial is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/l7_cTXSQWbM?si=oat6tPy21RXYJZ3a).   
#### Four systems to be built:
- **Folate-NADPH complex in aqueous environment for CHARMM**
- **Folate-NADPH complex in dhfr environment for CHARMM**
- **Folate-NADPH complex in aqueous environment for AMBER**
- **Folate-NADPH complex in dhfr environment for AMBER**
