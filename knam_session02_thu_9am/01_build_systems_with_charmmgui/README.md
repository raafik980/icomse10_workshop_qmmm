# Instructions to setup Folate-NADPH complex in aqueous and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme environments for CHARMM and AMBER
### A detailed video tutorial is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/l7_cTXSQWbM?si=oat6tPy21RXYJZ3a).   
#### Four systems to be built fro DFTB calculations, the we can modify the inputs for AM1 and Gaussan calculations, we will stick with CHARMM36m forcefield for MM part for all cases:
- **Folate-NADPH complex in aqueous environment for AMBER**
- **Folate-NADPH complex in aqueous environment for CHARMM**
- **Folate-NADPH complex in dhfr environment for AMBER**
- **Folate-NADPH complex in dhfr environment for CHARMM**


### 1.1. Inspect the pdb file from the template files generated by CHARMM-GUI QM/MM Interfacer in your local/personal machine
- **Note down the ID of atoms to be restrained in umbrella sampling simulations FROM PyMOL.**<p>
```bash
# Make the selection by atom from top-menu in PyMOL
-  Mouse -> Selection Mode -> Atoms

# Click only the donor carbon atom make the selection 'sele'
PyMOL> iterate_state 1, sele, print(segi, resi, name, ID)
PyMOL> deselect # Deselect the selection before making the next selection

# Click only the hydride atom make the selection 'sele'
PyMOL> iterate_state 1, sele, print(segi, resi, name, ID)
PyMOL> deselect # Deselect the selection before making the next selection

# Click only the acceptor carbon atom make the selection 'sele'
PyMOL> iterate_state 1, sele, print(segi, resi, name, ID)
PyMOL> deselect # Deselect the selection before making the next selection

# Example outputs for each iterate_state command (Note the ID of the atoms for umbrella sampling):
# HETD 1 C19 2681 # for donor carbon atom
# HETD 1 H26 2683 # for hydide atom
# HETB 1 C4 2577 # fo acceptor carbon atom
